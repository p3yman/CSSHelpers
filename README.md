# ðŸ“• CSSHelpers
This is a library of CSS classes to use directly in HTML templates. It'll help fix part of your templates without writing any CSS.


### Introduction
Just think about all the times that you wanted to make a border dissapear or add some margin to it. What you do? You add a class name or id to your element and then you write than one line CSS for it. Isn't that painful?

There should be a better way! Yes, there is ðŸ˜Š (Sorry for advertisment words)

In CSSHelpers you will find a full list of classes that make small changes to the element:
- Change the `dispaly` of the elemenet
- Add some flexbox property to it
- Add `margin` and `padding`
- Change `border-radius` to `0` or `50%`
- Change `position`

Do it really? Yes, really!
```html
<div class="mx-10 my-20 py-5 px-15 bd-n d-if">Save<div>
```

It's not like Tailwind CSS (and not trying to be) that create a complete website. It's just a small package to help you in your daily problems. 

I reccomend to add it to your every project and see how it helps in difficult times when you are working on bigger problems than what's the `font-weight` of a small element in a hero section.
